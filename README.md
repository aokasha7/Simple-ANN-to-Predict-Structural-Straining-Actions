# Simple-ANN-to-Predict-Structural-Straining-Actions
This is a simple code to build an ANN that has been trained and tested on predicting the straining actions in terms of bending moments and shear forces exerted on structural elements of a building during a seismic event.
This code was used to assess the applicability of utilizing deep learning models in making real time predictions for straining actions exerted on structural elements during seismic events in order to evaluate their structural integrity.
This sime model achieved an overall 99% accuracy on the prediction of bending moments straining actions on data simulated using SAP2000 structual analysis software.
